# Building Limine with all features in Nix.
#
# Independent of the packing in nixpkgs, This is convenient for prototyping and
# local development.
#
# These derivations always builds Limine from the current src tree and not some
# stable release. Further, unlike the nixpkgs derivation, this derivation runs
# the ./bootstrap step which needs network access. Due to the nature of the
# self-hacked Git submodules download approach, packaging this project in Nix
# is especially complicated. The complicated multi-derivation approach below
# is the best I can get after multiple hours of trying. :).
